# premium-user-conversion
The “freemium” business model — widely used by online services such as LinkedIn, Match.com, Dropbox, and music-listening sites — divides user populations into groups that use the service for free and groups that pay a fee for additional features. 

Given the higher profitability of premium subscribers, it is generally in the interest of company to motivate users to go from “free to fee”; that is, convert free accounts to premium subscribers. 

This project intends to analyze the data from an APP of an anonymized real music streaming company for potential insight to inform a “free-to-fee” strategy.
